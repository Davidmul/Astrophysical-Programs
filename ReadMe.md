Astrophysical Programs

Some scripts I have written to analyse Radio Data.

findfaradaypeak.py

To find the peak in Faraday spectra for a full datacube through interpolation and then apply found value to get Stokes Q,U and polarisation angle.

dusttemp.py

To correct for dust extinction in Halpha maps using the Newton-Raphson method.
Once found, resulting thermal and nonthermal maps are computed using equations from Tabatabei(2011).
